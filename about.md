# Who We Are

A small conglomerate of herbalists, health care providers, farmers/gardeners, plant enthusiasts, activists, family tenders, and community organizers and supporters.

We value anti-oppression work, ethical and sustainable farming, preserving wild places, horizontal power structures, greening the city and increasing access to herbal medicine by building community relationships, sharing skills, and growing high-quality medicine locally.
