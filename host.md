There is a spectrum of involvement available to those offering up their plots for the growing and harvesting of the community's herbal medicine! At a minimum, we will need help watering the plants, at a rate determined by the crew who will be tending the plants. But you can do more, if that brings you joy! Think about what you are able to contribute and what you’d like to get out the process.

* The pleasure of devoting your extra garden space to the wellbeing of local communities
* Our preference is for a minimum of ________2ft of space per garden so as to maximize the benefits of our traveling efforts
* The option to learn about herbs, their growth processes, and their preparation
* The knowledge that you’re contributing to the growing of medicine by watering plants between crew visits
* To value your time and contribution we will strive to use soaker hoses and other easy-to-use systems
* The benefit of developing relationships! Why not develop some casual or deep relationships with fellow plants lovers and/or the  plants themselves! Working with community and with plants can be deeply healing.
* We expect our crew to be present on your plot once or twice per month. You’re invited to come participate, but it’s not expected.
* Land beautification and connection to space! Often growing herbs means soil improvement and and flowers, attracting our beloved pollinators. Instead of simply seeing how we can help humans, we can also recognize that our actions impact the whole environment and benefit those other critters who are part of our world.

**Don’t have land but have other beneficial donations, such as tools, medicinal seeds, starts, finances, or something wonderful we haven’t even dreamed of yet? Please [contact us](/contact/) to see how we can put your donations/lendings to good use!**
