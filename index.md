The Herbal Access Project is a group of medicinal plant growers who want to cultivate access to botanicals for grassroots community groups.

We do this by partnering with local landholders and volunteers who desire to learn medicinal plant preparation and cultivation skills in the context of giving back to people and the land. All the medicine made is donated to folks serving their communities primarily through lenses of socioeconomic equality, anti-oppression work and first nations support.

With all of our work we hope to increase the public’s knowledge of and access to herbal medicine, improve our communities’ wellbeing and limit the impact of harvesting from intact and wild ecosystems through centering ethical urbancrafting.
