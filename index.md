# Herbal Access Project

![HAP](/images/hap.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

## Mission Statement


The Herbal Access Project is a group of medicinal plant growers who want to cultivate access to botanicals for grassroots community groups. We do this by partnering with local landholders and volunteers who desire to learn medicinal plant preparation and cultivation skills in the context of giving back to people and the land. All the medicine made is donated to folks serving their communities primarily through lenses of socioeconomic equality, anti-oppression work and first nations support.

With all of our work we hope to increase the public’s knowledge of and access to herbal medicine, improve our communities’ wellbeing and limit the impact of harvesting from intact and wild ecosystems through centering ethical urbancrafting.

## Opportunities for the Landholder

There is a spectrum of involvement available to those offering up their plots for the growing and harvesting of the community's herbal medicine! At a minimum, we will need help watering the plants, at a rate determined by the crew who will be tending the plants. But you can do more, if that brings you joy! Think about what you are able to contribute and what you’d like to get out the process.
* The pleasure of devoting your extra garden space to the wellbeing of local communities
* Our preference is for a minimum of ________2ft of space per garden so as to maximize the benefits of our traveling efforts
* The option to learn about herbs, their growth processes, and their preparation
* The knowledge that you’re contributing to the growing of medicine by watering plants between crew visits
* To value your time and contribution we will strive to use soaker hoses and other easy-to-use systems
* The benefit of developing relationships! Why not develop some casual or deep relationships with fellow plants lovers and/or the  plants themselves! Working with community and with plants can be deeply healing.
* We expect our crew to be present on your plot once or twice per month. You’re invited to come participate, but it’s not expected.
* Land beautification and connection to space! Often growing herbs means soil improvement and and flowers, attracting our beloved pollinators. Instead of simply seeing how we can help humans, we can also recognize that our actions impact the whole environment and benefit those other critters who are part of our world.

**Don’t have land but have other beneficial donations, such as tools, medicinal seeds, starts, finances, or something wonderful we haven’t even dreamed of yet? Please [contact us](http://herbalaccessproject.github.io/contact/) to see how we can put your donations/lendings to good use!**

## Opportunities for the Participant

### What an excellent mix of work and play!

We expect a minimum commitment of time dedicated to growing and harvesting herbs and planning for the months to come. What are you particularly excited about offering and learning?
* Get to know herbs! Whether you are newer to herbal medicine or were raised in the wild, we all have the opportunity to deepen our knowledge of and connection with beloved herbal allies. Supporting plants throughout the growing process is a pleasure and is sure to lend you something new.
* Get to know people. You’ll have the chance to get to know the other participants, as well as the potential to connect with landholders and even those folks who will be receiving the medicine when it’s ready to donate.
* We will have at least one monthly, half-day work party.
* We will have monthly planning meetings/medicine making parties.
* Develop basic knowledge about gardening in general and how to function as a team while growing plants.
* Discover way to connect with the land, even while in urban environments!
* Support to protection of native spaces by utilizing city spaces for medicine making instead of leaning on local natural environments which are threatened by overharvesting.
* Getting your hands dirty! Gardening can be active work, which is good for our bodies even before we ingest herbs!
