### What an excellent mix of work and play!

We expect a minimum commitment of time dedicated to growing and harvesting herbs and planning for the months to come. What are you particularly excited about offering and learning?

* Get to know herbs! Whether you are newer to herbal medicine or were raised in the wild, we all have the opportunity to deepen our knowledge of and connection with beloved herbal allies. Supporting plants throughout the growing process is a pleasure and is sure to lend you something new.
* Get to know people. You’ll have the chance to get to know the other participants, as well as the potential to connect with landholders and even those folks who will be receiving the medicine when it’s ready to donate.
* We will have at least one monthly, half-day work party.
* We will have monthly planning meetings/medicine making parties.
* Develop basic knowledge about gardening in general and how to function as a team while growing plants.
* Discover way to connect with the land, even while in urban environments!
* Support to protection of native spaces by utilizing city spaces for medicine making instead of leaning on local natural environments which are threatened by overharvesting.
* Getting your hands dirty! Gardening can be active work, which is good for our bodies even before we ingest herbs!

**The Herbal Access Project wants you! Please [contact us](/contact/) to see how we can put your donations/lendings to good use!**
