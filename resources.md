This two volume book rocks! So much great information about growing, medicinal uses, lore and so much more. More importantly she paints a picture of where these plants grew up, or their ecology. And by understanding how these plants evolved or what are these plant’s prefered ecosystem we can try and create a similar situation for the plant and let them grow in the conditions they are used to instead of micromanaging their existence.
