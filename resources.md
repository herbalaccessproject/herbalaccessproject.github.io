This two volume book rocks! So much great information about growing, medicinal uses, lore and so much more. More importantly she paints a picture of where these plants grew up, or their ecology. And by understanding how these plants evolved or what are these plant’s prefered ecosystem we can try and create a similar situation for the plant and let them grow in the conditions they are used to instead of micromanaging their existence.

In addition to the CSH and nursery they offer educational community gatherings to help us connect to the plants, our health and each other.
